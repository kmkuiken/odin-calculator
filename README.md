# odin-calculator
This is a simple calculator application made for The Odin Project
Users are able to input numbers into the calculator and evaluate
expressions, either one by one or in a large row.

This project was a good lesson in troubleshooting, bug fixing, and
bug finding.  Because there are so many different ways a user can
interact with this application, it becomes hard to find and deal 
with every fringe case possible.  Good testing from myself and 
others was crucial in squashing as many bugs as possible.
